# Hand-Gesture-Based-Calculator
This project is a real-time hand gesture-based calculator that allows users to input and evaluate mathematical expressions using only hand gesturesâ€”no keyboard or mouse required. It leverages computer vision and gesture recognition to detect hand signs representing digits, operators, and commands.
