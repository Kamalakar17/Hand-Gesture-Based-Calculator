# âœ‹ðŸ§  Hand Gesture Calculator using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This is a **real-time hand gesture-based calculator** that allows users to input and evaluate mathematical expressions using only hand gestures. Designed for accessibility and computer vision practice, it translates hand signs into digits, operators, and commands.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time gesture detection using webcam
- Supports multi-digit input (e.g., showing 2 â†’ 4 â†’ 7 becomes `247`)
- Gesture-controlled arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Built-in evaluation and result display
- Hands-free Clear, Delete, and Exit commands
- Works using a standard webcam (no special hardware needed)

## âœ‹ Supported Gestures

| Gesture                           | Function        |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1â€“5 fingers (one hand)            | Digits 1â€“5      |
| 5 + 1â€“4 fingers (both hands)      | Digits 6â€“9      |
| Only one hand with 0 fingers      | Digit 0         |
| 1 finger on both hands            | `+` (Add)       |
| 1 + 2 fingers                     | `-` (Subtract)  |
| 1 + 3 fingers                     | `*` (Multiply)  |
| 1 + 4 fingers                     | `/` (Divide)    |
| Both hands with 0 fingers         | `=` (Evaluate)  |
| Both hands with 5 fingers         | Clear input     |
| Both hands with 2 fingers         | Delete input    |
| Right index < Left index (space) | Exit program    |

> Gestures are detected based on hand landmark positions and finger states.
